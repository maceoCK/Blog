### What I learned today

1. Theory is nothing without practice
2. I am not a good programmer
3. Planning things out at the start leads to greater efficiency in the long run

### Theory is nothing without practice

Today, I had the privilege of participating in a competitive programming practice session with the Virginia Tech competitive programming team, made possible through the CS 2144 class. The experience was not only intellectually stimulating but also a testament to the incredible resources and opportunities available at Virginia Tech for students interested in computer science and programming.

For those who are fortunate enough to be students at Virginia Tech and are reading this post, I wholeheartedly recommend joining the club. The camaraderie, mentorship, and learning experiences within the team are invaluable, and you'll find a welcoming environment where your programming skills can flourish.

If you're a student at a different university, I encourage you to explore whether your school has its own ICPC team or a similar programming community. If such a group doesn't exist, consider taking the initiative to start one. Building a programming club or joining a competitive programming team can not only enhance your coding abilities but also open doors to new friendships and networking opportunities.

In the world of programming, there's no substitute for hands-on experience and learning from peers. So, whether you're a Hokie at Virginia Tech or a student elsewhere, seize every opportunity to engage with like-minded individuals, push your programming skills to new heights, and share in the joys and challenges of competitive programming.

### I am not a good programmer

As I sat down to participate in the competitive programming practice, I quickly realized that my theoretical knowledge of algorithms and data structures was not enough. I had spent countless hours reading books, watching online tutorials, and studying in my CS classes, but when faced with real coding challenges, I struggled.

It's a humbling experience to discover that theory is nothing without practice. While I had a good understanding of the concepts and the logic behind various algorithms, I found it challenging to implement them efficiently in a time-constrained, competitive environment. It became evident that competitive programming is a whole different ball game, and my skills needed serious improvement.

However, instead of feeling discouraged, I saw this as an opportunity for growth. I reminded myself that every great programmer was once a novice, and they, too, had to put in the effort to become proficient. It's all part of the learning process, and I'm determined to work hard and become a better programmer.

### Planning things out at the start leads to greater efficiency in the long run

One valuable lesson I learned today was the importance of planning before diving into coding. In the heat of the competition, I often found myself rushing to write code without thoroughly understanding the problem or devising a clear plan. This approach usually led to mistakes, debugging, and a loss of precious time.

As the practice session continued, I spent more time drawing out the problem, thinking about the specific data structure I wanted to use and the pros and cons of it, and then I would finally start writing out psuedo code to check my logic. Much like sharpening an axe before cutting down a tree it is best practice for a reason.

Not only did planning result in more efficient and bug-free code, but it also saved time in the long run. I realized that by investing a few minutes in understanding the problem and designing a solution, I could avoid hours of debugging and frustration later on. This strategy is not only applicable to competitive programming but also to real-world software development projects. Planning and thinking through a problem thoroughly before implementation can significantly increase efficiency and reduce the chances of errors.

In conclusion, today's competitive programming practice taught me that the journey from theory to practice is challenging but incredibly rewarding. It highlighted the need to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical skills, and it emphasized the significance of careful planning. As I continue my journey in competitive programming, I'm excited to apply these lessons, improve my coding skills, and take on future challenges with a more informed and strategic approach. If you're a student, I encourage you to explore the world of competitive programming and discover the joys and challenges it brings to your coding journey. It's a path to continuous learning and growth.
