# Post 1: Mojo, Kahns, and Debugging

## October 19th 2023

### What I learned today

1. Delayed understanding of kahn's algorithm.
2. What is MOJO, how does it work, and why should be be excited that it is coming to mac.
3. Debugging is important and using a debugger is something I need to watch a video on.
4. Hacker news and lobster are interesting and maybe I can be semi-productive in my procrastination.
