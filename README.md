# Blog
A public blog of Maceo Cardinale Kwik

## A Quick Introduction
Hello, thank you for joining me here on my blog. I am a computer science student at Virginia Tech.  
The reason I am making this blog is to both get much better at using **Markdown** and document my coding journey for both myself and anyone interested.

So, more about me: I am a 19 year old CS student fron New York City growing up in Brooklyn. I always want to learn and the way I learn best is via summarizing my knowledge and teaching it to others (thus this blog). I want to get a job in tech but I honestly feel that I havent explored enough to really niche down and say that I have truely found something that captivates my interest enough to work with it in a commited setting like a job.

## What Makes This Blog Special or Unique
Other than the fact that it is made by me (wow!). It is also going to follow me on a new goal of becoming a better techie every day and documenting that progress.  
This will be done in the following ways:
* Learning something new via online resources
* Starting, completing, and working on projects
* Documenting my failures
  * Noting what I could have done diffferently and what I would want others to learn though me via my failure
  * Sharing my future directions after that
* Talking about my daily life as a CS student and sharing how it relates to my future as a developer

**Before you say anything I know its not that unique, but just let me imagine for a moment**

Anyways, thank you for joining me on this journey and I hope you enjoy to watch my struggle.
